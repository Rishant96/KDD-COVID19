# KDD-COVID19
Corona virus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered corona virus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. For our group project we will using the COVID-19 in USA dataset that's found on kaggle. We will be performing data preprocessing (handling missing data, feature sampling, dimensionality reduction), data visualization, training and testing the model, and then come up with a final conclusion on the Covid-19 dataset to predict the mortality rate for different counties in each state of the United States of America based on median household income, unemployment rate, poverty rate, white alone %, black alone %, asian alone %, hispanic %
